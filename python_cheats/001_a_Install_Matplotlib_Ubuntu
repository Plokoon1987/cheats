Note: Matplotlib uses Tkinter, but Tkinter cannot be installed directly using pip in a virtualenv.
      It has to be installed in python so that all virtualenvs created after its installation will have it incorporated.


***** Verify Tkinter is installed *****
      
    1) Open a "python shell" an type "import tkinter"
        
	2)  -If it doesn't fail then it is installed!!!

	    -If it fails, you have to install tkinter for that python version:
		    sudo apt-get install python3.6-tk


***** Install matplotlib *****

	pip install matplotlib



***** OBSERVATIONS *****
