git clone --bare my_project my_project.git

If /srv/git does not exist:
  ssh pi@192.168.1.35 'sudo mkdir /srv/git'

Once folder exists:
  scp -r my_project.git pi@:192.168.1.35
  ssh pi@192.168.1.35 'sudo mv project.git /srv/git'

Access server:
  ssh pi@192.168.1.35
  cd /srv/git/america.git/

To allow access to All users in Host:
  git init --bare --shared

To customize access to users in Host:
  Change permissions to 'project.git to allow writting permissions to all
  developers that will be using it, perhaps put all users in a group and
  grant full permissions to that group:
      - chmod 770 -R project.git

  Now all users belonging to the group owning project.git will have full
  permissions

  Note: It is recommneded to look at creating Users and Groups in Linux. Also
        look changing main group for a specific user.
