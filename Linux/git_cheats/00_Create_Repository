1 - Navigate to directory where you want to host git repository (ie. /srv/git/)

2 - Create a folder named project.git ('project' is justa a sample name )

3 - Navigate to folder created (ie. /srv/git/project.git)

4 - Initialize the git repository in terminal with:
        - git init --bare

5 - Change permissions to 'project.git to allow writting permissions to all
    developers that will be using it, perhaps put all users in a group and
    grant full permissions to that group:
        - chmod 770 -R project.git

6 - Now all users belonging to the group owning project.git will have full
    permissions

Note: It is recommneded to look at creating Users and Groups in Linux. Also
      look changing main group for a specific user.
