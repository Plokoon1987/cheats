***** Create virtualenv (using python3.X) for 'project_name' *****
    
    Terminal (in ~/):
    
        mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.X project_name
    
    Note:   This will create a virtualenv, but it will also create a folder 'Devel/project_name'
            Go back to folder 'Devel' and delete folder 'project_name' (it will be created later with django)



***** Install packages in virtualenv *****
    
    - Inside 'Devel' create a file called requirements.txt and list all python packages to be installed, ie:
     
        #######
            django
            matplotlib
            psycopg2
        #######

    - pip install -r requirements.txt



***** Create django project *****

    django-admin startproject project_name

    - Move requirements.txt file inside the newly created folder 'Devel/project_name'
    

***** OBSERVATIONS *****
    
    Django project is now created
